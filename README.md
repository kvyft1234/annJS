```
  ai.setPerceptron(layerArr);
  //this is code that set Perceptron.
  //example : if "ai.setPerceptron([5,10,2,1]);" execute, layers set '[5,10,2,1]'
```

```
  ai.updateValue();
  //this calculates all value.
  //(calculates all perceptron as "activationFunction(sum of xw + bias)")
```

```
  ai.view();
  //can watch results
```
